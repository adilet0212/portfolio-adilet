## Overview
This project was developed **during my first co-op work term at the Ministry of Children, Community and Social Services (MCCSS)** as part of an internal **AI Hackathon**, where our team ranked **Top 5 among many participating teams**.

The goal was to build a **user-friendly interface** for an AI-powered ticket triage application.  
The tool was designed to intelligently classify, prioritize, and route service desk tickets using natural language processing and trained AI models.

My primary responsibility was the **UI and UX design** — transforming ideas into an intuitive, responsive frontend that allowed testers and analysts to interact seamlessly with the AI model.

## My Contributions
- Designed high-level **mockups in Figma** and low-fidelity **wireframes in Balsamiq**, ensuring consistent design flow.
- Implemented the **final Python Tkinter GUI**, creating interactive widgets for ticket input, AI response visualization, and performance metrics.
- Collaborated on the **dataset design**, curating and generating realistic **question–answer pairs** to train the NLP model.
- Integrated user input validation, dark/light themes, and modular layouts to enhance maintainability and accessibility.

## Highlights
- Developed an **end-to-end UI pipeline**, from concept sketches → Figma mockups → Tkinter prototype.
- Contributed to **training dataset generation**, improving the model’s understanding of real service request phrasing.
- Delivered the **final desktop app frontend**, showcased during the MCCSS AI development cycle presentation.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Tkinter (Python)
