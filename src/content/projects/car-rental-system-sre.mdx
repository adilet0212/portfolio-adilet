## Overview
Our **Car Rental Mobile Application** SRS (Software Requirements Specification) describes the entire lifecycle of a rental process — from registration and booking to payment and vehicle return.  

The document includes **functional and non-functional requirements**, **use case diagrams**, and **domain modeling**.

## My Contributions
- Authored the **scope definition, introduction, and key use cases**.
- Helped construct the **domain model**, including actors (Customer, Admin, Vehicle, Payment).
- Contributed to visual presentation and documentation structure for final group delivery.
- Ensured consistency across diagrams and traceability matrix alignment.

## Key Requirements
- **Functional:** Registration, vehicle browsing, booking, payment, cancellation, and notifications.
- **Non-functional:** Reliability, scalability, performance under 1000 concurrent users, and mobile compatibility.
- **UML Artifacts:** Use Case Diagram, Class Diagram, Sequence Diagram.

## Outcome
Delivered a fully-documented **SRS package** for stakeholder review and presentation to professor and classmates.  
Included system walkthroughs, screen mockups, and domain-driven design explanations.
