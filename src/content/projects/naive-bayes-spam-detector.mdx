## Overview
This project aimed to **detect spam in YouTube comments** using text classification techniques.  
We used a labeled dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and built a supervised learning pipeline leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and a **Multinomial Naïve Bayes** classifier.

Our workflow followed a complete ML lifecycle — from data preprocessing to evaluation and performance tuning.  
The model achieved **96.6% accuracy** and demonstrated excellent precision on spam detection tasks.

## My Contributions
- Led **feature engineering** and text cleaning using tokenization and stop-word removal.
- Implemented **TF-IDF transformation** and grid search to optimize model parameters.
- Visualized classification metrics (confusion matrix, accuracy chart, F1 score) in **Matplotlib**.
- Helped design presentation slides and summarized the findings for our final report and demonstration.

## Results
- Cross-validation mean accuracy: **93.9%**
- Test accuracy: **96.6%**
- Minimal overfitting and balanced precision-recall tradeoff.
