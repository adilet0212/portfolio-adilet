## Core Modules
- **Patient Management:** Add/search patients with validation to prevent duplicates.
- **Appointment Scheduling:** Conflict-handling triggers prevent double bookings.
- **Billing & Payments:** Automated cost calculations and detailed history reports.
- **Inventory System:** Auto-update triggers for stock-in/out and expiry tracking.

## My Contributions
- Developed and optimized **inventory management triggers and procedures** to maintain real-time stock accuracy.
- Implemented **inventory checking modules** for staff to query availability and expiration data.
- Designed and documented the **database schema** and **ER diagram** for all hospital entities.
- Coordinated integration testing with patient and appointment modules.

## Database Design
Entities include: Doctors, Patients, Appointments, Treatments, Medications, Inventory, Payments, and Insurance.  
Each is interconnected through foreign keys ensuring referential integrity and efficient query performance.

## Future Enhancements
- Automated **SMS/email reminders** for upcoming appointments.
- **Expiry alerts** for medicines nearing due dates.
- **Role-based access** and **audit trails** for enhanced data security.
